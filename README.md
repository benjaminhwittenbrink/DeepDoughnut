How to run a model MODEL_NAME? 

First, place the individual .npy files in a folder say DATA_DIR (importantly these photos should be separated by class within this folder). 

Then we can run:

main.py --data_dir DATA_DIR --model_name MODEL_NAME 


There are many other arguments to control batch_size, epoch_n, etc.
